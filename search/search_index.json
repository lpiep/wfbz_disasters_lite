Firedpy (www.github.com/earthlab/firedpy) is an algorithm that converts these rasters into events by stacking the entire time series into a spatial-temporal data cube, then uses an algorithm to assign event identification numbers to pixels that fit into the same 3-dimensional spatial temporal window. This particular dataset was created using a spatial parameter of 5 pixels and 11 days. The primary benefit to this dataset over others is the ability to calculate fire spread rate. For each of these products (events and daily) the event identification numbers are the same, but the event-level product has only single polygons for each entire event, while the daily product has separate polygons for each date per event.</p> <p>This download contains a \"daily\" and \"event\" format.

However, a global analysis of the WUI has been lacking.</p> <p>This dataset features a global, 10 m resolution map of the wildland-urban interface, representative for ca. 2020.</p> <p>The data are organized in tiles of 100 km x 100 km and follow the EQUI7 tiling grid and projection system. The images are compressed GeoTiff files (.tif). There is a mosaic in GDAL Virtual format (.vrt), which can readily be opened in most Geographic Information Systems. Please consider the generation of image pyramids before using *.vrt files.</p> <p>In addition, the data contain tabular data on WUI area, population and biomass in the WUI, as well as wildfire area and people affected by wildfire in the WUI per world region, country, subnational administrative unit and biome.</p>"},{"location":"raw_data_desc/wui/#bands","title":"Bands","text":"<ul> <li><code>WUI</code> - Values:</li> <li>Forest/Shrub/Wetl.-dominated intermix WUI</li> <li>Forest/Shrub/Wetl.-dominated interface WUI</li> <li>Grassland-dominated intermix WUI</li> <li>Grassland-dominated interface WUI</li> <li>Non-WUI: Forest/Shrub/Wetland</li> <li>Non-WUI: Grassland</li> <li>Non-WUI: Urban</li> <li>Non-WUI: Other</li> </ul>"}]}
