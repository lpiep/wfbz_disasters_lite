Firedpy (www.github.com/earthlab/firedpy) is an algorithm that converts these rasters into events by stacking the entire time series into a spatial-temporal data cube, then uses an algorithm to assign event identification numbers to pixels that fit into the same 3-dimensional spatial temporal window. This particular dataset was created using a spatial parameter of 5 pixels and 11 days. The primary benefit to this dataset over others is the ability to calculate fire spread rate. For each of these products (events and daily) the event identification numbers are the same, but the event-level product has only single polygons for each entire event, while the daily product has separate polygons for each date per event.</p> <p>This download contains a \"daily\" and \"event\" format.
