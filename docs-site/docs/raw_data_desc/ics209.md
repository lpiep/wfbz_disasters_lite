# ICS209

ISC209s are forms submitted to the Federal Government to describe emergencies. St. Dennis et al have 
published code to clean and harmonize historical ICS209 data (their project is called ICS209-PLUS), 
but only publish the resulting data through 2020. To recreate and extend their procedure, we need to 
obtain the raw ICS209 summaries from USFS. The current year and historical summaries are kept separately.

"Current year" apparently means
fires that occur or are still occurring in the current year, so in order
to capture a hypothetical fire that ends on 12/31 we should be running the 
updated daily (or, at the very least, yearly on the last day of the year).

## Historical Summaries

1999 - 2023 are available as MS Access EXEs here: https://www.wildfire.gov/application/sit209. 

For current year data, you'll need to obtain approval to access the FAMWEB database from USFS IT. I contacted the contact for FAMWEB listed on [wildfire.gov](https://www.wildfire.gov/contact-us). 

## Current Year Summaries

You can access current year summaries at https://famdwh-dev.nwcg.gov/sit209/cognos_report_queries/sit209_data_report.
Ask your contact at USFS IT to provide the current credentials, or contact [me](mailto:loganap@uw.edu).
