# ICS209

ISC209s are forms submitted to the Federal Government to describe emergencies. St. Dennis et al have 
published code to clean and harmonize historical ICS209 data (their project is called ICS209-PLUS), 
but only publish the resulting data through 2020. To recreate and extend their procedure, we  
obtained the raw ICS209 summaries from USFS, and processed a limited number of variables. This procedure
and the resulting data set are described in its own [Github repository](https://github.com/lpiep/ics209_minimal).
