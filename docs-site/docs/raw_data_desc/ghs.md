## Summary 

The spatial raster dataset depicts the distribution of population, expressed as the number of people per cell. Residential population estimates between 1975 and 2020 in 5 years intervals and projections to 2025 and 2030 derived from CIESIN GPWv4.11 were disaggregated from census or administrative units to grid cells, informed by the distribution, density, and classification of built-up as mapped in the Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL) global layer per corresponding epoch.

We downloaded the 100m resolution datasets for years 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2020. 

_Note:_ These files are very large (7-8GB per year).
